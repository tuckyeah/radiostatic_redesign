                        <p>MY DEAR --</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I write to you positively <em>humming</em> with excitement and anticipation- after so many fruitless moons of searching, I truly finally believe I am close to finding the Nexus of Information and voices for which we have searched! Our future seems to be <em>brimming</em> with possibility!</p>
                        <p>It has been three days since I pulled off the highway and ended up here. I stumbled across this place entirely on accident - I was longing for a Cold Beverage and a Smoke to file the edges of my nerves and (Ask and you Shall Receive), I soon happened upon this makeshift Bar in an Airstream out in the middle of this wasteland.</p>
                        <p>Little did I know, that was but the Tip of the Iceberg!</p>
                        <p>Though there is no one else here at present, this ... <em>place</em> seems to be a waypoint of sorts for people just like us: lost and like-minded individuals who are driven on a quest to find the Truth and to let the Current of the Planets Course through our Lives!</p>
                        <p>I have seen drawings of Constellations and Galaxies on the bathroom walls just like the sketches we used to make in our Journals and Reports together. I ran my fingers over the marker and thought for a moment maybe it would have been better if we drew them on walls instead of paper - our Message would have spread better, perhaps, been more permanent.</p>
                        <p>Though it would have been harder to burn.</p>
                        <p>I have been spending each day at the bar (though I PROMISE only to insinuate myself among the locals in order to document my findings for you) and the Bartender and his Young Friend have revealed themselves to be most hospitable. I told them I was a Man on a Mission and, with nary a clarifying question, they equipped me with my very own Fine Winnebago Camper not a hundred yards from where we stood. It is not much compared to their beautiful War-Era farmhouse (or, dare I say, our own?), but it is a place to rest my head and my Trusty Typewriter (from which I write to you now), so I am quite content.</p>
