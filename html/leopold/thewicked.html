                        <p>When you pulled the barrel of my shotgun and nuzzled it against your heart-shaped chin That Night, I knew there was no turning back.</p>
                        <p>"I've got to do it," you said, as if you could read my mind, My Dear. I stared into your eyes down the barrel of the shotgun, my finger trembling on the trigger, but you were so confident, so sure. "It's the only way to go. I must do it for us, for Our Sweet Jeremiah. Please understand."</p>
                        <p>You put your both your hands on the barrel to steady it, for my hands were shaking Something Awful. I could feel the bones of your jaw through its metal, and for a brief moment, we were connected by that shotgun, all of us one living being.</p>
