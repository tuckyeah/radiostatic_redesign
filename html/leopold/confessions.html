                            <p>MY DEAR -- </p>
                            
                            <p>It has been a lonely few weeks, though things seem to have perked up a bit today with the addition of a new Face to our Humble Settlement, a Mr. Charlie Waits.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Waits is another soul who seems to have found himself lost here, and we have a developed somewhat of a kinship over the past few days. I will not be so bold to call it anywhere near 'friendship,' as that word seems entirely antithetical to the very Aura of this arid and hostile environment, but we have certainly forged a connection and I have frequently found myself grateful for his company.</p>
                            <p>Although, since his arrival, I have had the strangest dreams... that he (or someone like him) and a woman, June Variable, are also here to help with our Search. I have mentioned her name to Charlie only once, and he gave me the Strangest Look - I dare not mention her again. I am too lonely to risk Losing someone else.</p>
 
                           
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="section-1">
                    <div class="fadeIn">
                        <div class="letter">
                            <p>Between the loneliness and the Dreams, I fear this means I am growing Weaker, and the Darkness is returning. I worry there is little I can do to control my turns - you know as well as I that I am helpless in its grasp. I am trying to stave off the tides of self-hatred and loathing that threaten to consume me. I can only trust you know that the Spirit is willing, even if the Mind may falter.</p>

                            <p>I am trying not to lose hope. Increasingly, I find myself only taking solace in the memories of our younger days. When we began, we were so full of hope. </p>
                            <p>
                                Can you even recall those days now? Thinking back on them seems like digging through the contents of some Stranger's attic; everything is covered with dust and the thick scent of decay.
                            </p>
                            <p>I miss you something Wicked, but I know your Work is more important than my Foolish Heart. I am continuously in awe of you commitment to Our Cause. On my Weakest Days, I am ashamed to say I wish I could have joined you, but I know it is my duty to stay here, to Explore this Earth whilst you search the Great Beyond. Our Sweet Jeremiah is somewhere, My Dear, and I know we will find him soon.</p>

                            <p>Forgive me, My Dear. I hope you can find it in your Wondrous Heart to continue to place your Trust in me.</p>
