                            <p>I am trying not to lose hope. Increasingly, I find myself only taking solace in the memories of our younger days. When we began, we were so full of hope. </p>
                            <p>
                                Can you even recall those days now? Thinking back on them seems like digging through the contents of some Stranger's attic; everything is covered with dust and the thick scent of decay.
                            </p>
                            <p>I miss you something Wicked, but I know your Work is more important than my Foolish Heart. I am continuously in awe of you commitment to Our Cause. On my Weakest Days, I am ashamed to say I wish I could have joined you, but I know it is my duty to stay here, to Explore this Earth whilst you search the Great Beyond. Our Sweet Jeremiah is somewhere, My Dear, and I know we will find him soon.</p>

I will not be so bold to call it anywhere near 'friendship,' as that word seems entirely antithetical to the very Aura of this arid and hostile environment, but we have certainly forged a connection and I have frequently found myself grateful for his company.
