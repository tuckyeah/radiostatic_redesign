                                  <p>Charlie showed me the 'reports' and we read and reread the pages until we were sure we had panned every last flake of gold from them.</p>
                                  <p>"Charlie... This man almost certainly killed his son himself. I mean, look at this. This is insane. This can't be the boywho we're looking for."</p>

                                   <p>Charlie didn't say anything, and that in and of itself was disconcerting. He just kept flipping through the pages. At first, I thought he hadn't heard me, but then he slowly nodded his head.
                                   <p>"You're right."
                                   <p>This wasn't like Charlie. He never gave up so easily. Something was wrong.</p>

                                   <p>Charlie reached into his shirt pocket and dug out the worn piece of paper we had been carrying with us for how many miles, the missing persons poster with the black and white, Xerox bleached face.</p>
                                   <p>"You can't even make out the face anymore, it's just shapes... like a Rorschach drawing." </p>

                                   <p>He was right, of course: there was nothing left of the face but the black smudges that hinted at the edges of features, a portrait in negative space.</p>
                                   <p>"Who are we looking for, June? Can <em>you</em> remember?"</p>
                                   <p>I studied it long and hard and came to the alarming realization that I could not remember the face either.</p>
