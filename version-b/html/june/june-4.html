                                    <p>Leopold lived in a Winnebago about a hundred yards back from the Bar. It'd been out there so long, it faded into the landscape.</p>

                                    <p>Like a chameleon, its once-white paint was now the same light orange as the sand -- even the rust holes in the wheel wells look like the shadows cast by the dunes.</p>
                                    <p>I was reminded of what the Bartender said about people coming here to hide, and I think of how apex predators camouflage themselves in plain sight.</p>

                                    <p>I did not tell Charlie about these thoughts. He is delighted to have a sense of purpose, to find ourselves in  a position where we may be able to find a sense of resolution, finally, to this drive that has been pushing us for so long.</p>
                                    <p>I did not tell him my concerns about what a resolution will mean for us - and by extension, me - either.</p>

                                    <p>Fortunately, the old man  was more hospitable than his surroundings, and he warmly welcomed us into his humble lodgings. We sat at his Formica table and sipped watry powdered lemonade from paper cups in silence.</p>
                                    <p>After what I deemed to be an appropriately polite amount of time, I tried to gently prod him. "So you mentioned you are missing your son? Can you tell us a little more about that?"</p>

                                    <p>Leopold didn't say anything for a moment, just slid his cup across the table, the rim leaving a wet glistening wave.</p>
                                    <p>For another beat, we all sat transfixed at the cup's comet-tail arcing across the table.</p>
                                    <p>"My wife and I have been searching for our dear boy for what feels like an eternity. We realized, some time ago, that we could accomplish more if we split up. 'Divide and Conquer,' as they say."</p>
